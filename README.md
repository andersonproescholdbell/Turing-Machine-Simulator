# Turing-Machine-Simulator
This is a lightweight Turing Machine simulator coded in C++. One can create states and transitions inside the main method of main.cpp, or modify main.cpp to read in a file and parse the states/transitions from that. The code assumes no errors are committed creating states and transitions, but it would not be difficult to add error checking at the cost of readability. There is an example in the main method of a "Majority" Turing Machine which accepts if there are more 1s than 0s in a binary string. The tape uses characters but could be modified to integers. The simulator is only as Turing-complete as your RAM is!
This was coded with a Unix operating system. If you are trying to compile and run on Windows, you may need to remove the "unistd.h" include and "usleep()" call.
